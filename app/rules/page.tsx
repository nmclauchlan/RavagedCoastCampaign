      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Campaign Rules</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The campaign will be using the rules in the <strong>Ravaged Coast</strong> book, the <strong>Path to Glory</strong> rules in the 4th edition Core Book do not apply. The <strong>General's Hand Book</strong> is not used so no Battle Tactics! Players are expected to bring their copy of Ravaged Coast to each game.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Roster Creation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Rules for roster creation are laid out in the Ravaged Coast book:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>A unit cap of 350 points (excluding Sons of Behemat heroes).</li>
          <li>A limit of 1000 points total.</li>
          <li>Unique heroes are allowed, but not preferred (350 point limit still applies).</li>
          <li>If your army has a battletome, you can use the ‘Anvil of Apotheosis’ for a narrative feel.</li>
          <li>Kitbashed heroes are strongly encouraged, as well as a cool model for your regiment of renown.</li>
          <li>Allies are allowed, but no other Regiments of Renown outside the Ravaged Coast Book.</li>
        </ul>
        Be careful when creating your roster - you won't be able to change it without spending shards.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Try to bring a physical copy of your roster written in pencil. If you are unable to photocopy the roster pages in the back of the book, a blank roster will be provided for you.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Aftermath Sequence</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The aftermath sequence <strong>MUST</strong> be completed at the end of every game. Update your roster and return it to the folder behind the counter. Your opponent must be able to see your dice rolls. You can bank Emberstone Shards if you'd like, but you cannot update your roster before a game. The aftermath sequence takes about 10-15 minutes.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Emberstone Shards</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Emberstone shards should be presented differently to objective tokens/markers. Creating emberstone clusters on a 40mm base is encouraged. Cut up some sprue and use your painting skills to make it look like glowing hot shards, or however you imagine Emberstone to look.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Game Length</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Game lengths are variable and can potentially go on for 6 rounds. If you are tight on time, ask your opponent if you can cap at 5 rounds. Remember you still need to do the aftermath sequence once the battle has ended.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Battleplans</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Path to Glory is your story, so no two battles will be the same. There will be no set battleplan for each round, so you must roll on the table for each round. If you roll on a battleplan that you or your opponent have already played, you can reroll on the table for a different one if you wish.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Winning the Campaign</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Once a player has won a Major Victory on Hel's Claw, the campaign ends and that player is declared the winner. However, you can continue to keep playing through the event should you choose to do so.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Catch-Up Games</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are unable to attend any rounds, you can arrange to play a catch-up game with someone in the league on a day that suits you. Catch-up games must be played in store. If you wish to switch between armies throughout the campaign, you may do so, but you cannot play more than one game per army per week.
